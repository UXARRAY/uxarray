# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors, creators, stewards, and maintainers (collectively referred to as "contributors" below), of GeoCAT projects pledge to make participation in our software, system or hardware project and community a safe, productive, and welcoming experience for everyone. All contributors are required to abide by this Code of Conduct. This includes respectful treatment of everyone regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, level of experience, nationality, political affiliation, veteran status, pregnancy, genetic information, physical appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation, as well as any other characteristic protected under applicable US federal or state law.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviors that contribute to a positive environment include:

- All contributors are treated with respect and consideration
- Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative
- Communicate openly with respect for others, critiquing ideas rather than individuals and gracefully accepting criticism
- Acknowledging the contributions of others
- Avoid personal attacks directed toward other contributors
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow contributors
- Alert UCAR staff and suppliers/vendors if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress
- Respect the rules and policies of the project and venue

Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form
- Physical, verbal, or written abuse by anyone to anyone
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Personal attacks directed at other guests, members, contributors, etc.
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Alarming, intimidating, threatening, or hostile comments or conduct
- Inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images
- Threatening or stalking anyone, including a contributor
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by UXarray whether they be physical, online or face-to-face. This includes project code, code repository, associated web pages, documentation, mailing lists, project websites and wiki pages, issue tracker, meetings, telecons, events, project social media accounts, and any other forums created by the project team which the community uses for communication. In addition, violations of this Code of Conduct outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the `@UXARRAY/uxarray-dev` GitHub handle as the community leaders
in this group can view and manage the reported content, and hence are responsible
for enforcement.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.
