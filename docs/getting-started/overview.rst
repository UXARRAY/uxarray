Why UXarray?
============
UXarray aims to address the geoscience community need for tools that enable standard
data analysis techniques to operate directly on unstructured grids. It extends upon
and inherits from the commonly used Xarray Python package to provide a powerful and
familiar interface for working with unstructured grids in Python. UXarray provides
Xarray styled functions to better read in and use unstructured grid datasets that
follow standard conventions, including UGRID, MPAS, SCRIP, ICON, HEALPix, and Exodus formats.


Unstructured Grids
==================
The "U" in UXarray stands for "Unstructured Grids". These types of grids differ from
typical Structured Grids in terms of complexity, requiring additional overhead to
store and represent their geometry and topology. However, these types of
grids are extremely flexible and scalable.

UXarray uses the `UGRID <http://ugrid-conventions.github.io/ugrid-conventions/>`_
conventions as a
foundation to represent Unstructured Grids. These conventions
are intended to describe how these grids should be stored within a NetCDF file, with
a particular focus on environmental and geoscience applications. We chose to use a
single convention for our grid representation instead of having separate ones for each
grid format, meaning that we encode all supported unstructured grid formats in the
UGRID conventions at the data loading step.

Specifically, our core functionality is built around two-dimensional
Unstructured Grids as defined by the 2D Flexible Mesh Topology in the
UGRID conventions, which can contain a mix of triangles, quadrilaterals, or
other geometric faces.


Core Data Structures
====================

UXarrayâ€™s core API revolves around three primary types, which extend Xarray for unstructured-grid workflows:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 0

   * - :py:class:`uxarray.Grid`
     - Represents the unstructured grid itself, housing grid-specific methods and topology variables. Encapsulates a :py:class:`xarray.Dataset` for storing the grid definition.

   * - :py:class:`uxarray.UxDataset`
     - Extends :py:class:`xarray.Dataset` to operate on unstructured grids; linked to a :py:class:`~uxarray.Grid` instance via its ``uxgrid`` property.

   * - :py:class:`uxarray.UxDataArray`
     - Similarly extends :py:class:`xarray.DataArray` and exposes a ``uxgrid`` accessor for grid-aware operations.



Core Functionality
==================

In addition to loading and interfacing with Unstructured Grids, UXarray provides
computational and analysis operators that operate directly on those grids. Some of
these include:

* Visualization
* Remapping
* Subsetting
* Cross-Sections
* Aggregations
* Zonal Averaging

and `User Guide <https://uxarray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide.html>`_
