However, along simply changing the `k` value may not have a large impact on the remapping, and you might also need to change the `power` value, because the `power` value changes how much influence a point has as it gets further away from the source point. Let's use do two remaps, a high and low `power` / `k` value and see a side by side comparsion with downsampling."

    "When we alter the `k` and `power` values during downsampling, we observe only minor effects. This is somewhat expected because downsampling involves transitioning from a grid with numerous faces to one where several faces are consolidated into one. Consequently, regardless of how many neighboring faces we consider, the impact remains limited, especially given the weighted calculation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, during upsampling, the effects are much more pronounced. This is logical, considering that upsampling involves transitioning from a grid with fewer faces, where each face represents a larger area, to one where more faces are present, representing a smaller area per face. Therefore, adjusting from 2 neighbors to 128 leads to substantial changes because the additional faces encompase a much larger area, and by effect much more drastic changes in values."
