Supported Grid Formats
======================

Overview
========

UXarray supports multiple unstructured grid formats, each of which is encoded in the UGRID conventions when loaded.

* UGRID
* MPAS
* SCRIP
* EXODUS
* ESMF

While each of these formats can be encoded in the UGRID conventions, the amount of information that is parsed from
the grid varies. The following sections describe how each format is converted and what variables can be expected.
